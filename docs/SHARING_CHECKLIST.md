```

---

## ⚠️ **Important Disclaimers to Include**

When sharing, make these clear:

1. **Academic Use**
   > "This calculator is intended for educational and research purposes.
   > Always cite original academic sources (Gillespie, Husain, Plett)
   > in your work, not this implementation."

2. **Validation Level**
   > "Model validated to ±3-5% accuracy for standard drive cycles.
   > Suitable for thesis work and early-stage design. NOT certified
   > for production vehicle development."

3. **Limitations**
   > "Uses quasi-static models. For production use, consider dynamic
   > simulation, CFD/FEA, or commercial tools (AVL CRUISE, GT-SUITE)."

4. **No Warranty**
   > "Provided AS-IS under MIT License. Use at your own risk.
   > Authors not liable for any damages or inaccuracies."

## 📊 **Expected Reception**

### **Positive Reception Expected:**

👍 **Students & Researchers** (90%)
- Looking for thesis-quality code
- Need working implementation
- Want validated models
- Appreciate documentation

👍 **Educators** (85%)
- Teaching material
- Course projects
- Lab demonstrations
- Learning resource

👍 **Industry Engineers** (70%)
- Early-stage design
- Feasibility studies
- Quick prototyping
- Reference implementation

### **Potential Criticism:**

👎 **Experts May Say:**
- "Simplified models (not CFD-level accuracy)" ← TRUE, acknowledged
- "No extended Kalman filter" ← TRUE, basic Coulomb counting only
- "Linear battery OCV model" ← TRUE, real batteries non-linear
- "Simplified drive cycles" ← TRUE, use official WLTP data for certification

**Response:** All limitations are DOCUMENTED. This is thesis-quality,
not production certification. Users are informed.
